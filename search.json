    "text": "About the Project\nMariculture is a rapidly growing industry in Alaska, with farmed Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas) currently significantly contributing to this industry’s profit. However, there are no wild oysters in Alaska and the high-latitude estuarine environment of southeast Alaska differs greatly from many other areas in the country where oysters are currently farmed. Therefore, it is important to determine environmental factors that influence oyster health to optimize growing conditions at existing oyster farms and to aid in site selection for future farms as the industry grows. Another challenge associated with farmed oysters is harmful algal blooms (HABs), with paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) from Alexandrium spp. diatoms being of particular concern for public health in the region. Determining which factors contribute most strongly to the health of farmed oysters, as well as to toxin levels in oyster tissue, is critical in allowing oyster mariculture to expand in a safe and profitable way in southeast Alaska.\nAs part of an ongoing HAB monitoring project, water column and oyster tissue sampling occurs weekly from March to October, and monthly from November to February, at a local oyster farm in Juneau, Alaska. This project is funded by the NOAA Office of Aquaculture, and collaborators include staff at the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Alaska Sea Grant State Fellows, students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, NOAA Hollings Scholars, and the owner and employees of the oyster farm, Salty Lady Seafood.\nData have been collected since 2018, and include the following:\n\nWater column parameters (temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, and chlorophyll levels) at 1 meter and 5 meter depths\nEnvironmental conditions (season, air temperature, weather, tide height, and wind speed and direction)\nPSP toxin levels in oyster tissue and in the water column at 1 and 5 meters\nLipid content and fatty acid composition in oyster tissue\nPhytoplankton community composition via a plankton net tow and phytoplankton counts in water samples from 1 and 5 meters"

    "text": "Impact of Phytoplankton Community and Environmental Conditions\nLipid content and toxin levels in oyster tissues do not appear to be strongly impacted by variation in phytoplankton community composition (Figure 9), although there is a negative relationship between dinoflagellate counts and toxin levels in oyster tissue (p<0.05, R^{2}=0.35). Variation in phytoplankton community composition is partly driven by season (p=0.001) along NMDS1 and by environmental conditions (p<0.01) along NMDS2 (Figure 9). Environmental conditions also display significant linear relationships with lipid content and toxin levels in oyster tissue. Toxin levels have a negative relationship temperature (p<0.01, R^{2}=0.31) and a positive relationship with salinity (p<0.001, R^{2}=0.68), while lipid content has a marginally significant positive relationship with temperature (p<0.1, R^{2}=0.15).\n\n\n\nFigure 9. NMDS on phytoplankton community data from May to October 2022, with significant environmental variables overlaid as vectors. The shape of each point displays season, with points colored by either lipid content (%) in oyster tissue (A) or PSP toxin levels (ug/100g) in oyster tissue (B) from the same date."

Air temperatures are lower in winter and higher in summer, with weather remaining variable throughout the year (Figure 1). Similar to air temperature, water temperature at both 1 and 5 meters is lower in winter and higher in summer (Figure 2). Salinity follows the opposite pattern; salinity is lower in the summer due to high rainfall and glacial runoff, and higher in the winter when many of the freshwater input sources are frozen (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
