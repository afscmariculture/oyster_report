title: Oyster Health and Toxicity

## Overview 

There is high variation in both lipid content and PSP toxin levels in oyster tissue, especially in late summer and early fall of 2022 (Figure 8). The two have a significant inverse relationship (p<0.05, R^2=0.22), with lower lipid content and higher toxin levels, most noticeable in early summer 2022 (Figure 8).

## Impact of Phytoplankton Community and Environmental Conditions

Lipid content and toxin levels in oyster tissues do not appear to be strongly impacted by variation in phytoplankton community composition (Figure 9), although there is a negative relationship between dinoflagellate counts and toxin levels in oyster tissue (p<0.05, R^2=0.35). Variation in phytoplankton community composition is partly driven by season (p=0.001) along NMDS1 and by environmental conditions (p<0.01) along NMDS2 (Figure 9). Environmental conditions also display significant linear relationships with lipid content and toxin levels in oyster tissue. Toxin levels have a negative relationship temperature (p<0.01, R^2=0.31) and a positive relationship with salinity (p<0.001, R^2=0.68), while lipid content has a marginally significant positive relationship with temperature (p<0.1, R^2=0.15).

The shape of each point displays season, with points colored by either lipid content (%) in oyster tissue (A) or PSP toxin levels (ug/100g) in oyster tissue (B) from the same date.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67389727/203434646-553617a4-1247-4735-a662-41542e958c66.jpg)
