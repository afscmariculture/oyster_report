title: Phytoplankton Community Composition
---

## Overview 

Phytoplankton community composition varies seasonally, with blooms typically occurring in summer months. Peaks in chlorophyll-a levels tend to align with these summer blooms (Figure 3). Overall, phytoplankton biomass is higher at 5m (Figure 3B) than at 1m (Figure 3A). In 2021 and 2022, the five most abundant phytoplankton genera were *Chaetoceros*, *Pseudo-nitzschia*, *Skeletonema*, *Thalassionema*, and *Thalassiosira* (Figure 3).

## Impact of Nutrient Levels 

Nutrient data (nitrite and phosphate levels in uM) are only available for 2021 at this time. Nitrite levels are lower during and after summer blooms (Figure 4); while phosphate levels are more variable, they are also slightly lower during and after summer blooms (Figure 5). Some variation in phytoplankton community composition is also explained by nutrient levels. Nitrite levels significantly contribute to variation in phytoplankton community composition at 1m (p=0.001) and 5m (p<0.05) along NMDS2 (Figure 6), while phosphate is not significant (Figure 7).
