This is a template for a simple Quarto website that looks like a "book". This is a common format for documentation. It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to `theme.scss`. The webpage will be on the `gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch. 

The following data is collected:

* Click the green "use template" button to make a repository with this content.  Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn't work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch).

* Turn on GitHub Pages under Settings > Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory.

* Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the  Settings > Pages page to find the url.
